Task: The task is to analyze the datasets to answer several key questions:

What were the least and most ordered items? What categories were they in?
What do the highest spend orders look like? Which items did they buy and how much did they spend?
Were there certain times that had more or fewer orders?
Which cuisines should be focused on developing more menu items based on the data?

Action: The following SQL queries were performed:

Selecting all items from the menu.
Counting the total number of items on the menu.
Identifying the least and most expensive items.
Counting the number of Italian dishes.
Finding the least and most expensive Italian dishes.
Counting the number of dishes in each category.
Calculating the average price of dishes within each category.

Result: 

The analysis provided detailed insights into the restaurant's menu, including the distribution of dishes across categories, price ranges, and specific details about Italian dishes.

Reflection:
